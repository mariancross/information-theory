# Information Theory Task

## Requirements

* C++14
* Python3 (matplotlib, numpy)
## Task 2.1

* n can be up to 64 as words are defined using the `uint64_t` datatype.
* A word is initially zero and the bits that form the word are shifted accordingly. Namely, the most significant bits are shifted first and the padding is implicit.
